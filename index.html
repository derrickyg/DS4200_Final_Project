    <h1> Social Media Impact on Stock Market Volatility</h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p>For the past few decades, the world has become increasingly connected through technology. 
        Within it, social media has expanded beyond its message-sharing origins to become a 
        prominent source of influence in many other spheres. Social media's potential to bear 
        influential power over the financial markets was notably demonstrated during the 
        Reddit-induced January 2021 GameStop and AMC share price fiascos, leading to the 
        coining of the term “meme stock.” However, publicly traded companies are discussed 
        all of the time on social media. Even when not on the scale of the Gamestop and AMC situation, 
        social media-induced decisions of buying, holding, and selling are entirely possible.
        Our question: How much power does social media really have over the stock market? 
        How can something as regulated, technical, and concrete as the financial markets be 
        influenced by something as simple as a social media post?
        </p>

    <p>Exploring social media's impact in this sphere is important because as shown with Gamestop, 
        spiraling social media trends in the financial industry can lead to severe economic losses 
        for solo investors and companies; which could cause economic uncertainty, increased unemployment, 
        and recessionary movements. What started as a playful joke with Gamestop became a mass market 
        impact that required federal action — and social media has no signs of slowing its interconnectedness and broad influence.

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> We used a Kaggle dataset titled “Tweet Sentiment’s Impact on Stock Returns” to conduct our analysis. This featured 862,231 rows, 
        each corresponding to a tweet that contains the name of a publicly-traded company. There are 14 columns in the dataset that include 
        the stock name, date of the tweet, and trading volume directly following the tweet’s publication. It also features 1, 2, 3, and 
        7-day returns, 10 and 30-day volatility, and sentiment scores. These scores were concluded from pre-trained Long Short-Term Memory 
        and Textblob NLP models that we used in order to process emotions and get a feel for the tweets. Below is the name and description
        of the specific columns used in our analysis:</p>  

        <div class="center">
        <table class="tg">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th class="tg-0lax">Variable Name</th>
                <th class="tg-0lax">Details</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">STOCK</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">The name of a publicly traded stock that was mentioned in the Tweet</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Date</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Date of tweet's publication</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">LAST_PRICE</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">The price of the stock directly following the tweet's publication </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">x_DAY_RETURN</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">The stock's returns after x days of the tweet's publication</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">VOLATILTY_yyD</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">The tweet's volatility on yy day</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">LSTM_POLARITY</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Sentiment score from Long Short-Term Memory model</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="tg-0lax">TEXTBLOB_POLARITY</td>
                <td class="tg-0lax">Sentiment score calculated from Textblob NLP model</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>We filtered out stocks that had a TextBlob sentiment score between -0.05 and 0.05 - these
            tweets were not deemed to have a strong sentiment in either direction. Furthermore, we
            also added industries for certain stocks for aid in our visualizations.</p>


        <h3>Overview of our data   </h3>
        
        <div class='container'>
            <div class='image'>
                <img src="sentimenthist.png" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></img>
            </div>
            <div class='image' style='float: left;'>
                <iframe src="avg_return_tweet.png" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
        </div>      

        <p>
            Our starting point involved a plot that would give us a general overview of the data. 
            We created a baseline visualization to better understand the data and see if this 
            was even worth pursuing, creating a histogram with the distribution of sentiment
            scores along the tweets, plus the mean 2, 3, and 7-day return for each sentiment value.
            We realized that there were tweets on both ends of opposite sentiment extremes, along 
            with what could be potential spikes and decreases in the returns. We knew we had to 
            continue with our analysis because there were potential trends that could be crucial 
            if discovered.
        </p>

        <h3> The relationship between unemployment rate and other social factors</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>Moreover, we also want to examine the relationship between
                    unemployment rate and other social factors in the data. All 
                    features are numerical thus we firts create a correlation
                    plot to examine whether there are linear relationship between 
                    unemployment rate with other social factors. Notice that if 
                    the correlation is small, it only means that there is no potential
                    linear relationship between two features. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty 
                    has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                    they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single 
                    parents is the second important feature which inidicates the 
                    stability of family is also strongly related to the job market. 
                    The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase 
                    of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                    with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                    high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear
                    relation with the unemployment rate is Metropolitan, which means the 
                    percent of residents living in a metropolitan area. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = 'image'>
                <img src="boxfinancial.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>
            </div>   
        </div>

        <div class = 'image'>
            <img src="boxtech.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>
        </div> 

        <p>
            Based on the scatter plot below that plots the sentiment of a tweet compared to
            its 7-day return, return doesn’t increase alongside sentiment in absolute terms. However, 
            the spread of returns does increase with an increase in sentiment. We used a 
            color map so that the prevalence of data points would be more visible to a user, 
            given that there were over 800,000 tweets in the dataset to visualize.
        </p>
        
        <div class = 'image'>
            <img src="cmap.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>
        </div>

        <p>Next, we created a graph that tracked how frequent each stock appeared in the tweet data and 
            compiled the top 10 stocks. Ford was seen the most with a count of over 20,000 tweets written 
            about the it, followed by Facebook and Google, which are two technology companies. Ford was 
            the only company from the automobile sector to make the top 10, and Next was the only industrial.
            The other companies were all consumer or entertainment focused — given the prominence of companies 
            like Amazon, Netflix, and Disney — along with social media mention, showing that companies with direct 
            consumer-facing interfaces or products were spoken about the most.</p>

            <img src="sector.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>
        </div>


        <p>We have also create an interactive scatter plot so that 
            our users can select a couple of states within
            a certain range of unemployment rate and to see how the 
            other factors may be related here.

            <iframe src="scatter.html" width="85%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Compare MA to the other states</h3>

        <p>
            Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between
            MA and other states. We create the following interactive plot
            such that user can choose another state to compare with MA and 
            show the bar plot on each factors. 
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="d3scatter.html" width="95%" height="300px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            It was difficult to come to a definitive conclusion on the correlation between tweet polarity and stock returns
            for a few reasons. 
        </p>

        <p>First, There are many factors that impact a stock’s return and volatility. Outside factors 
            such as economic factors, market rates, and performances are all contributors to the price of a stock, and our 
            dataset was not able to factor those in.
        </p>
        <p>
            We only had access to tweets, whereas many other powerful media outlets could also have influence, such as Facebook 
            or Instagram. Returns and tweets could be reversely correlated, where bad returns or high volatility prompt more tweets, 
            while good returns may be ‘expected’ by public investors.
        </p>

        <p>At the individual security level, we were unable to produce a reliable model or visualize the relationship between tweets, 
            polarity, and financial metrics. However, our data did follow expected industry-related trends and showcased some insight 
            into the relationship certain industries may have with social media.
